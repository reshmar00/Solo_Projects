                    Hi there! I'm currently pursuing my Master of Software Development
                    degree at the University of Utah, set to graduate in December 2023.
                    Before diving into this exciting journey, I had a blast working in education,
                    language editing, and advertising. These experiences have given me a well-rounded
                    perspective on the importance of effective communication, attention to detail, and creative
                    problem-solving. I'm always thrilled to find opportunities to apply these skills
                    and collaborate with others.<br /><br />
                    Feel free to connect with me â€“ let's chat programming, tech stacks,
                    or anything else that sparks our interest!
                </p>
            </div>
            <Footer />
        </div>
